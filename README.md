# What is this

It is an error capture and playback system that can catch all page faults in a non-intrusive way, by integrating with our logging system, we can view these logs, and (more importantly) we can reproduce all user actions in the period before the error occurred, including OneStrata pages, all actions of the user:Â  mouse tracks, typing, scrolling, submitting, everything.

# How to use

Just import a javascript file to Onestrata page, then you could see the replay before the error occurred in our log(monitor) system.

# Benefits

Discover the hidden problems of the system and improve the user experience by viewing logs and playback.
